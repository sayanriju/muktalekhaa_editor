Installation Instructions for 
	Muktalekhaa
	
A Bangla Phonetic Text Editor
	for GNU/Linux
	  Systems
################################

Current Version : 1.3+
License: GPL ver 3


Dependencies:
---------------------------

1) python 2.5.* or later.
2) wxpython 2.8.* or later
N.B. In some distros (like Ubuntu) this package is called python-wxgtk2.8
3) Atleast one bangla unicode font

Make sure ALL the above dependencies are installed in your system. Most distros provide their binary packages, so use the default package manager to install them.
Otherwise, go to their respective websites and download and compile them from source.

Python : http://python.org/
wxPython : http://wxpython.org/
Bangla Fonts: http://ekushey.org/ , http://www.bengalinux.org/

Remember, the installer script doesn't attempt to resolve/check dependencies, so in case they are not installed, Muktalekhaa will simply fail to start, spitting out error messeges.



Installing Muktalekhaa
------------------------------

 * Download the source tarball from  http://code.google.com/p/muktalekhaa/downloads/list
 * Untar it : tar -xvvf muktalekhaa-editor-1.0.tar.gz
 * Change directory : cd muktalekhaa
 * Run installer script as ROOT: sudo ./installer
 (if sudo is not configured on your system, do a 'su' to become root, and then run     
 './installer')
 * This should have installed Muktalekhaa under /usr/share/muktalekhaa
 * To run the program, issue the command 'muktalekhaa' w/o quotes from a terminal.
